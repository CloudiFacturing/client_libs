# Infrastructure Clients
This repository should be used to share clients for various infrastructure components in CAxMan. 

The reason why we want to share them here is that eRoom is a bad platform for sharing code. And especially so when it comes to keeping it up to date.

This repo is structured as "/<component>/<language>/".

When you add a client, please add it to the list beneath, and also add a README.md in each client folder describing how to start using it, its dependencies, etc.
